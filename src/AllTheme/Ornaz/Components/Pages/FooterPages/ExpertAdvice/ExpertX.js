          <h2>Caring for Your Diamonds</h2>
          <p>Diamonds are one of the hardest substances on earth, but they still require proper care to maintain their brilliance. Here are some expert tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean your diamonds regularly using a solution of warm water and mild dish soap.</li>
            <li>Use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the diamond, especially underneath where dirt can accumulate.</li>
            <li>Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry with a lint-free cloth.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching your diamonds unnecessarily, as the oils from your skin can dull their sparkle.</li>
            <li>Store your diamond jewelry separately to prevent scratching other pieces or getting scratched.</li>
          </ul>
